# Cryptocurrency Volatility, Future Trends and Social Media Influence
David, Nick & Milena

# Presumption
Cryptocurrency has a reputation for being very volatile. It has recently seen explosive price growth, which has generated investment interest in this particular area. However, many people have refrained from investing in Cryptocurrencies, because of a reputation of high volatility, a lack of regulation, and Cryptocurrencies are generally not an acceptable method of payment for most products or services. 
Furthermore, Cryptocurrency is a very new phenomenon, only having entered mainstream vernacular in the last few years. 
Over time, and particular with the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, some Cryptocurrencies are now starting to be seen as a genuine investment option. 
We sought to clarify these assertions, and see whether Cryptocurrencies are becoming more stable (or less volatile) as time has passed, and if the currencies are becoming more stable as they become more mainstream.
Furthermore, we sought to clarify if Social Media and Traditional Media sources were having an effect on cryptocurrency prices, trade volumes, and volatility.  

# Key Qestions
We asked three key questions during our investigations.
*  Are cryptocurrencies more volatile than traditional currencies? 
*  Are there any visible trends in volatility rates of cryptocurrencies over time, either positive or negative? Are Cryptocurrencies becoming less volatile (more stable investments) as they become more mainstream?
*  Is there a correlation between tweets / social media word mentions / trends / sentiment, versus cryptocurrency prices, trade volumes and volatility?
